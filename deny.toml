# Temporary exception for RUSTSEC-2026-0001 (rkyv OOM issue). This is a tracked
# technical debt item and should be removed once upstream patches rust_decimal/
# openraft to depend on a safe rkyv >= 0.8.13.
# Transient transitive dependency (rkyv) pulled in via rust_decimal -> byte-unit -> openraft;
# no safe upgrade available yet. Tracked in repo issue.
